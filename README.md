## Tomas Garcia

I am a curious and eager learner junior full-stack developer trained at Makers Academy. I have a strong background in creative processes, education and technology in the music industry, which I applied in team-work type of settings. These skils have been very important tools in my evolution as a Developer.

From starting as an interested amateur coder to wining the Skill Bootcamp Scholarship and completing the intensive 12 weeks of Makers Academy, has prepared me as a competent and confident junior developer.

I like that working in the tech industry is a career of continuous growth. In this industry my main goal is to expand my knowledge as a web app and full stack developer.
