## Tomas Garcia
I am a curious, self-motivated, eager learner, and a junior full-stack developer trained at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). I have a strong background in creative processes, education, and technology in the music industry, skills I consistently apply in teamwork settings. These skills have been key tools in my growth as a Developer.

Since I started as a curious amateur coder fast-forwarding to winning the Skill Bootcamp Scholarship at [Makers](https://makers.tech/), which lead me to one of the best and most intensive professional experiences, a complete and intensive 16 weeks Full-Stack training. Now I can assuredly say that I have grown into a competent and confident junior developer.

One of my favorite parts of the tech industry is that is a career of continuous growth. In this industry, my main goal is to expand my knowledge as a front-end, and full-stack developer.

## Related Work Experience

**Tomas Garcia Music** (March '16 to November '21)  
_Music Studio Owner_

As a freelance drumset teacher, Audio Engineer, and studio owner I was self-motivated to start and organize different music projects. I had to design a drumset lessons curriculum, self-assist and produce my remote drum tracking for clients, promote my business and bring new clients to my roster.

**2k12 estudios** (February '12 to June '16)  
_Drummer/Composer_

 *2k12 estudio*, was a music production, composition, and sound design service for the Audiovisual Industry. As one of the partners and founder members, I was one of the composers and studio musicians. We worked and researched different, and creative, ways of applying music and sound to the moving images. During my time in the company, I was in charge of the creation and supervision of the website contents and design, as well as developing our collective view of the direction of the company.

**Team Work**
I am a devoted supporter of the idea that the best results for a project or work environment come from a group of people working together with the same goal in mind, where each part brings their experiences and expertise to the task that is on hand. I always keep myself open to learning and improving on best ways of developing a dynamic and healthy working environment, e.g., Agile methodology, my or others' previous work experience. As a studio owner and company partner, a big focus was always to keep fluent and appreciative communication with clients and colleagues.

**Tech Fluent**
Throughout my career as a musician, I consistently used and learned software and hardware technology for music production, recording, and teaching. Such as DAWs (Logic Pro, Protools, Sibelius, Ableton live, etc... ), and hardware such as compressors, EQ, compressors, and such. I used these tools to produce and deliver high-end music and recording productions. As well as developing a more dynamic and modern teaching curriculum, and lessons. As a result, I manage to deliver professional standards production faster, and form well-rounded students.

**Avid Learner**
Keeping myself up to date with the changes that my industry is having has always been a highly enjoyable part of what I do. Seen where trends are going or what new update in a piece of software or hardware is coming. As well as solidifying the fundamental concepts of what I do, giving me a solid foundation to absorb these new changes and challenges.  As a musician every project was bringing at least one new element, technological or skills base, that was completely new to me that I have to quickly learn and apply with confidence.
I am currently learning MERN looking to gain a solid understanding of these technologies and how they work together.

**Clean and Simple Code**
Writing or doing something the 'Simplest' way might be probably the most challenging approach to a task, that is an awesome challenge.
As a programmer, I have always kept a strong focus on making my code simple, easy to read and maintain. Reviewing other people's code has been a great tool to improve in this subject, something that I highly enjoy. Probably most of my growth as a programmer comes from sharing and discussing with fellow Devs about coding and reviewing each other's work.
This is a mindset that comes not just as a Dev, as a musician, I have always looked for the solution that I think works best, and is the simplest for the situation. Trying to build projects on very small tasks and with clarity.
