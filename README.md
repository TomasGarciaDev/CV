## Tomas Garcia
I am a curious, self-motivated, eager learner, and a junior full-stack developer trained at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). I have a strong background in creative processes, education, and technology in the music industry, skills I consistently apply in teamwork settings. These skills have been key tools in my growth as a Developer.

Since I started as a curious amateur coder fast-forwarding to winning the Skill Bootcamp Scholarship at [Makers](https://makers.tech/), which lead me to one of the best and most intensive professional experiences, a complete and intensive 16 weeks Full-Stack training. Now I can assuredly say that I have grown into a competent and confident junior developer.

One of my favorite parts of the tech industry is that is a career of continuous growth. In this industry, my main goal is to expand my knowledge as a front-end, and full-stack developer.
